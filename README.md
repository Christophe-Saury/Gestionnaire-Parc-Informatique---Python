# Software-and-Hardware-Manager--Python
App in python that can manage the computers and softwares run by a company. Was built for a school project with tkinter and SQLite.

My school required me work in pairs to make an app in Python that could manage the computers and softwares run by the school. 

The app should be able to :
- Visualize all the computers of the school, their characteristics, their id, the operating system they use and show whether the SolidWorks and Proteus 
license is expired or not.
- Add a new computer
- Modify the characteristics of any one computer
- Delete a computer
- Do a simple search and show the results

Additional functionality we added :
- Do a multi-criteria search and show the results

Potential Upgrades :
- Allow the school to have several campuses and be able to select any one of them and base results on this.
- Make a web site instead of a local app
- Make the app look better and reuse the color scheme from the school logo
